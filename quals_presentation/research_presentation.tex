In this presentation, we focus on steering and acceleration control. Our goal is to \textbf{disentangle hardware-dependent control algorithms from higher-level software.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Steering an Autonomous Vehicle}
Major concerns when steering an autonomous vehicle:
\begin{itemize}
\item Safety: vehicle must not lose control or stray from a safe path.
\item Comfort: Steer and accelerate smoothly, reducing jerk (change in acceleration).
\item Fuel efficiency: avoid unnecessary control inputs.
\end{itemize}

However, not all applications weight these equally.
\begin{itemize}
\item Autonomous delivery truck: maximize fuel efficiency.
\item Autonomous taxi: provide a comfortable and enjoyable ride.
\end{itemize}
%Configurable behavior is already on the market: many ADAS systems allow switching between ``sport" and ``eco-friendly" driving modes.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/configurability.png}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

% UNNECESSARY TO HAVE THIS SLIDE
% Just talk in words about modal changes (Lall's word) such as trucks driving different from cars.
%	\begin{frame}
%\frametitle{Software reusability perspective}
%Changing behavior is also a high-level goal.
% COMMENT: Is this a digression?
%\begin{columns}
%	\begin{column}{0.65\linewidth}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item What speed does the vehicle drive at?
%	\item What lane does it drive in?

%\end{figure}
%\end{column}
%\end{columns}
%\vspace{1.0em}
%However, to plan these behaviors the autonomy software must know what its hardware is capable of.
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item If our trajectory planner is platform-independent, it can't take advantage of the full %capabilities of the hardware.
%	
%	\item If our planner is hardware-dependent, it will be difficult to port the software to new %vehicles.
%\end{itemize}

%\end{frame}
% 2.How is it solved today? What are the limits of current practice?

\frametitle{Literature review}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Trajectory Tracking with Waypoints}
Tracking controllers follow a given path as closely as possible. Many approaches are possible, including PID and tracking MPC.

Challenges with trajectory tracking:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Tuning PID gains
		\item Proving a PID controller is stable
		\item Developing controllers for complex vehicle models that represent the interactions between tires, axles, vehicle body, suspension, etc.
	\end{itemize}
\textbf{Problem: A higher-level module must have enough information about vehicle hardware to generate the waypoints.}
\end{frame}
	
	% 3.What is the new technical idea?
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Trajectory Optimization: Beyond Waypoints?}
Some controllers optimize the vehicle's trajectory: for example, by determining the best path in a safe driving corridor.
\vspace{1em}
\begin{columns}
	\begin{column}{0.6\linewidth}
High-level software could provide this safe corridor and driving goals. The exact path is determined by the steering controller.
	\end{column}
	\begin{column}{0.3\linewidth}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/many_trajectories.png}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\vspace{1em}

Some challenges with this approach:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Nonlinear dynamics add difficulty to the optimization problem.
	\item The safe corridor the vehicle can drive in is difficult to represent.
	\item The dynamics model must be computationally tractable.
	\item The optimization must run in real time.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example Applications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dynamic maneuvers such as emergency braking / steering
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requires accurate knowledge of hardware capabilities
	\end{itemize}
	\item Stopping at a stop sign (an interesting problem)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Need a flexible interface so the controller can smoothly switch between objectives
	\end{itemize}
% Need a flexible enough interface to the controller that it can smoothly switch between objectives.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/stop_sign.png}
\end{figure}
% Another thing you can add to this slide is dynamic maneuvers, e.g. emergency braking, avoidance maneuvers, where the vehicle behavior is really complicated and one needs a really complicated model to execute those correctly.

% It's reasonable future self-driving cars will need this capability.

\end{frame}

	

%\begin{frame}
%\frametitle{Improving Software Reusability}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Trajectory optimization allows higher-level autonomy software to operate with little knowledge of vehicle hardware.
	
%	\item High-level modules provide a goal (``drive at this speed", ``stop at the stop sign", ``slow down and take this exit off the highway") and constraints (a safe corridor to drive in, obstacles to avoid).
	
%	\item Lower-level optimization, with access to hardware parameters (possibly via estimation), computes control signals to meet this goal.
	
%	\item High-level software can be deployed quickly to a wide range of vehicles, while the low-level software is customized for specific platforms.
	
%	\item Providing a clean break between hardware independent and dependent software simplifies reusability and safety certification.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}	

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Proposed Division}
High-level software operates without much knowledge of hardware capabilities.
% Knows basic information that informs mode changes: e.g. large delivery vehicles do not drive in the left lane, some vehicles limited to certain speed, etc.
\begin{itemize}
\item Provides a desired speed
\item Provides a safe driving corridor
\item Provides specific goals for low-level controller (stop at stop sign, hold constant speed on freeway)
\end{itemize}

Vehicle-specific controller optimizes this path.
\begin{itemize}
\item Accounts for hardware capabilities
\item Accounts for user preferences (comfort, fuel efficiency, etc.)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/division.png}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{MPC Trajectory Optimization}
Model-predictive control (MPC) is a good choice for the low-level controller.
\begin{itemize}
\item Weighting different objectives is an intuitive way to adjust driving behavior
\item Constraints can represent an allowable corridor to drive in, guaranteeing a trajectory won't violate safety requirements.
\item Vehicle kinematics models can be switched out without requiring major modifications to the controller.
\item The controller provides an abstraction to higher levels of the autonomy stack.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Trajectory Optimization Challenges}
Nonlinear optimization is difficult to implement.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Convergence to an optimal solution isn't guaranteed.
	\item In a complex problem, it can be difficult to determine why the solver failed or produced an unexpected result.
	\item Discretization of the vehicle dynamics and road corridor can introduce problems if not accurate enough.
\end{itemize}

Trade-off between model accuracy and computational tractability.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Even ``simple" models can be difficult to discretize.
	\item Adding complexity worsens this issue, but is necessary to handle a full range of driving conditions.%(example: knowledge of tire-road interactions is important in an emergency stop).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Implementation of MPC controller}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.38\linewidth]{figures/kinematic_diagram.png}
	\caption{Kinematic bicycle model, commonly used in MPC controllers.}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{equation}
\text{State } z = \begin{bmatrix}
x\\y\\v\\\psi
\end{bmatrix},\quad \begin{bmatrix}
\dot x\\\dot y\\\dot v\\\dot\psi
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
v\cos(\psi + \beta)\\
v\sin(\psi + \beta)\\
a\\
\frac{v}{l_r}\sin(\beta)
\end{bmatrix}
\label{eq:kinematic}
\end{equation}
$\beta$ is the angle between the car velocity and its longitudinal axis \eqref{eq:beta}.

\begin{equation}
\beta = \tan^{-1}\Big( \frac{l_r}{l_f + l_r}\tan(\delta_f) \Big)
\label{eq:beta}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider $N$ lookahead steps $k=1,\dots,N$ spaced $\Delta_t$ apart
\item The control signals are $a$, the longitudinal acceleration of the car, and $\delta_f$, the steering angle of its front wheels. $u = [a\ \delta_f]$
\item The nonlinearity is confined to the dynamics model \eqref{eq:kinematic}
\item The cost function is quadratic in state $z$ and control $u$
\item The state and control constraints are representable by linear inequalities at each step
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-1.0em}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/mpc_figure.png}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Implementation: Cost Function}
Define a multi-objective cost function. Changing the weights on each term will change the driving behavior.
\begin{equation}
J_{accuracy} = \sum_{k=1}^N\Big\| \begin{bmatrix}
x_k\\y_k\\\psi_k
\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}
x_{center,k}\\y_{center,k}\\\psi_{center,k}
\end{bmatrix} \Big\|_2^2
\label{eq:costcenter}
\end{equation}
where $(x_{center,k}, y_{center,k}. \psi_{center,k}$ describe the $x-y$ position and angle of a desired point on the road (more on this later).
\begin{equation}
J_{speed} = \sum_{k=1}^N (v_k - v_{desired,k})^2
\label{eq:speed}
\end{equation}
%Equation \eqref{eq:costcenter} controls the accuracy of the path-following behavior, while \eqref{eq:speed} controls how closely the vehicle stays at the desired speed.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Equations \eqref{eq:costjerk} and \eqref{eq:coststeering} penalize undesirable sharp changes in acceleration and steering angle.
\frametitle{Implementation: Cost Function}
\begin{equation}
J_{jerk} = \sum_{k=2}^N (a_k - a_{k-1})^2
\label{eq:costjerk}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
J_{steering} = \sum_{k=2}^N (\delta_{f,k} - \delta_{f,k-1})^2
\label{eq:coststeering}
\end{equation}

Combine these terms to define the cost function:
\begin{equation}
J = a_1 J_{accuracy} + a_2 J_{speed} + a_3 J_{jerk} + a_4 J_{steering}
\label{eq:costfinal}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Implementation: MPC Problem}
Define the nonlinear MPC problem:
\begin{align}
\text{minimize}\quad& J(z_1,\dots,z_N, u_1,\dots,u_N)
\\
\text{subject to} \quad& z_{k} = f(z_{k-1}, u_{k-1}),\ k=1,\dots,N
\\
& u_{min} \leq u_k \leq u_{max},\ k=1,\dots,N
\\
& v_{min}\leq
v_k\leq
v_{max}\ k=1,\dots,N
\\
&
A_k\begin{bmatrix}
x_k\\y_k\\
\end{bmatrix} \geq 0,\ k=1,\dots,N
\end{align}
$A_k$ is the matrix of linear inequalities describing the road boundaries at the $k$th step.

The ``min" and ``max" bounds on $u$ and $v$ are constant.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Implementation Challenges}
A major issue was representing the road accurately and efficiently.

Proposed solution: Use polygons to approximate the road at each step  $k=1,\dots,N$.
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/road_polygons.png}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.5em}
Then the position constraint on $x_k,y_k,\ k=1,\dots,N$ is simply a set of linear inequalities.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Implementation Challenges}
This caused a lot of issues because it was difficult to generate the polygons without unnecessarily constraining the vehicle speed.
% A simplification I thought of to reduce coding issues (which loses the guarantee that the vehicle will stay in a bounded region, although in practice large accelerations are penalized) is to use the right and left boundaries, but leave the rear and front open.

Simplification: use the right and left boundaries, but leave the rear and front open.

\vspace{-0.25em}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/road_final_bounds.png}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.5em}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Implementation Challenges}
Another major issue was formulating a cost function that causes the vehicle to move forward without  unnecessarily penalizing velocity changes.

If we start with a (suboptimal) speed estimate, choosing points on the road center for steps $1,\dots,N$ without introducing ``noise" in the cost function is difficult.


\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{figures/centering_issue.png}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.5em}

Solution: use previously computed trajectories to generate the center points.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Performance on ISO Lane Change}
The ISO double lane change path is a test performed by human drivers on a real track, but is also used in some papers on autonomous driving.

The controller was implemented in Python using CasADi for symbolic math and Ipopt.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The linear boundaries successfully overlap to represent curved roads.
	\item The vehicle behavior can be changed using the weights on the cost terms.
	\item Because the road boundaries are a hard constraint,the vehicle cannot stray out of the road corridor. Deviations from the center of the road are only penalized, allowing it to make small adjustments to its path.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Performance on ISO Lane Change}

In this slide, we see the results of several test runs. The ``accuracy" and ``speed" weights were successively increased: jerk and steering change weights remained the same at $100$ and $10$, respectively.

\begin{frame}

The error between the road center and vehicle path decreases with increased weight on $J_{accuracy}$.

\frametitle{Changing Model Parameters}

The kinematic bicycle model has 2 parameters: the distances between the vehicle CG and rear/front axles.

\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/road_paths_cg.png}
\end{figure}


Changing these parameters does not destabilize the system, though
larger control inputs are computed.

All 3 runs were computed with cost:
$$J = 0.1J_{accuracy} + J_{speed} + 100J_{jerk} + 10\frac{180}{\pi} J_{steering}$$
which corresponds to the ``mid-range" performance seen on previous graphs.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Changing Model Parameters}

The error between the road center and vehicle path is almost unchanged.

	\item Programmed a nonlinear MPC controller for vehicle steering and longitudinal acceleration
	\item Demonstrated ability to easily change vehicle parameters
	\item Configurable driving behavior via weighted multiobjective cost function.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Future research directions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determine appropriate cost function weights for modal changes (example: coming to a stop vs traveling at constant speed).
	
	\item Faster and more reliable methods of solving nonlinear MPC problems.
\item Real-time estimation: vehicle parameters can change slowly (tire degradation, temperature change), rapidly (driving over a patch of ice) and while parked (loading/unloading cargo).

%\frametitle{Reliable Trajectory Optimization}

%Nonlinear optimization algorithms aren't guaranteed to produce an optimal result and can fail unexpectedly: undesirable behavior in a safety-critical application such as autonomous driving.

%Many approaches seek to eliminate nonlinearity.
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item
%Taylor approximation: linearize around a nominal trajectory. If the cost is quadratic, this produces a convex problem that can be quickly and reliably solved.

%However, if the solution strays too far from the nominal trajectory, it is inaccurate. Local approximations also lose information about the system dynamics.

%\item Feedback linearization: 

%\item Koopman linearization: a dimensional lifting method that approximates a nonlinear problem as an infinite-dimensional linear problem.
